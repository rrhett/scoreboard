# Gameboard

Server that shows a gameboard (e.g. on a monitor) that can be controlled and
updated from another device (e.g. phone, while playing). Meant for casual usage.

## Games

Initial implementation will be for Five Crowns, a fun party game. Hopefully this
repository expands and can be templated for other games.
